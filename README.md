### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in the JavaScript ecosystem. I build responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and React JS with Vite.js, styled with Tailwind CSS for modern and clean designs. On the server side, I use Node.js with Express.js to create scalable APIs, leveraging Docker for containerization to ensure consistent development and deployment environments, integrate PostgreSQL databases, and implement secure authentication with Passport.js and JWT. I also work with Git and GitHub to keep my code organized and versioned.

Passionate about learning new technologies and applying best practices to build efficient and well-structured web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences and am constantly exploring ways to improve and grow as a developer.
