### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer with solid knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem. My technical expertise spans front-end development with HTML, CSS, and React JS powered by Vite.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. On the back end, I work with Express.js on Node.js, implementing PostgreSQL databases and authentication using Passport.js and JWT. I manage my projects using version control with Git and GitHub.

Passionate about creating complete and functional web solutions, combining attractive user interfaces with robust back-end architectures. Always looking for new challenges that allow me to continue growing as a developer and add value through modern and efficient web applications.
