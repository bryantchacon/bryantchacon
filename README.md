### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bryant ChacÃ³n a self-taught Technical Artist. I studied the [Video Games School](https://platzi.com/p/bryantchacon/ruta/42-videojuegos/diploma/detalle/) and the [Video Games Development path in Unity](https://platzi.com/p/bryantchacon/ruta/16-desarrollo-unity/diploma/detalle/), and many other things, at Platzi.

While studying I was interested in both art and video game programming and didn't know which to decide on, but the more I advanced the more I saw that to achieve better results I had to know something about both and that's how I discovered Technical Art, which excited me since I didn't have to decide on one thing or another.

I love learning new things in this field to improve my skills and focus on Shaders, VFX, Materials, 3D Modeling and Texturing.
