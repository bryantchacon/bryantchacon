### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer currently expanding my expertise in the JavaScript ecosystem to create responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and React JS with Vite.js, styled with Tailwind CSS for modern and clean designs. On the server side, Node.js with Express.js to create scalable APIs, leveraging Docker for containerization to ensure consistent development and deployment environments, integrate PostgreSQL databases, and implement secure authentication with Passport.js and JWT. I also work with Git and GitHub to keep my code organized and versioned.

Passionate about new technologies and applying best practices to build efficient and well-structured web applications turning ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences and constantly exploring ways to improve and grow as a developer while working toward creating my first complete applications.
